# Process Scheduling

Process scheduling is a fundamental concept in operating systems that involves determining the order in which processes are executed on a computer system's CPU (Central Processing Unit). It plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient utilization of system resources and providing an acceptable level of responsiveness to user requests.

## Goals of Process Scheduling

The primary objectives of process scheduling are as follows:

1. **Fairness**: All processes should have a fair chance to utilize the CPU's resources.
2. **Efficiency**: The system should aim to maximize CPU utilization and minimize idle time.
3. **Responsiveness**: Processes requiring quick responses, such as interactive applications, should be given priority.
4. **Throughput**: The system should maximize the number of completed processes over a given time period.

## Scheduling Algorithms

Operating systems employ various scheduling algorithms to determine the order in which processes are selected for execution. Some commonly used algorithms include:

### 1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
This algorithm schedules processes in the order they arrive. The CPU is allocated to the first process in the queue, and it continues to run until it completes or voluntarily yields the CPU.

### 2. Shortest Job Next (SJN) or Shortest Job First (SJF)
This algorithm selects the process with the shortest burst time next. It aims to minimize the average waiting time and provides optimal throughput for a given set of processes. However, predicting the burst time accurately is often challenging.

### 3. Round Robin (RR)
Round Robin scheduling assigns a fixed time slice, called a time quantum, to each process in the system. Each process is allowed to run for its time quantum and then preempted to give other processes a chance. This algorithm ensures fairness but may result in increased overhead due to frequent context switches.

### 4. Priority Scheduling
In priority scheduling, each process is assigned a priority value, and the CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority. This algorithm can be either preemptive or non-preemptive, depending on whether a higher-priority process can preempt a running process.

### 5. Multilevel Queue Scheduling
This algorithm divides processes into multiple queues based on priority or other criteria. Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm, such as FCFS, RR, or priority scheduling. Processes move between queues based on predefined rules, such as aging or priority changes.

### 6. Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling
Similar to multilevel queue scheduling, this algorithm assigns processes to multiple queues. However, it allows processes to move between queues dynamically based on their behavior. For example, a process that frequently uses the CPU may be moved to a lower-priority queue.

## Context Switching

Context switching is the process of saving and restoring the state of a process so that it can be resumed later. When a scheduling decision occurs, the currently running process's context is saved, and the context of the selected process is restored. Context switching introduces some overhead due to the time required to perform the switch, but it is necessary for process scheduling and ensuring fairness.

## Conclusion

Process scheduling is a vital component of operating systems, responsible for determining the order in which processes are executed. Various algorithms are employed, each with its own advantages and trade-offs, to achieve fairness, efficiency, and responsiveness. Context switching enables the system to switch between processes, allowing for multitasking and optimal resource utilization.
