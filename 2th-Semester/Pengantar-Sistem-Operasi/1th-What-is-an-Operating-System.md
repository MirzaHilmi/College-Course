# Introduction to Operating System

Operating system is a crucial subject in computer science and electronics, and you may encounter it in your academic curriculum. In this course, we will explore the theory and practical aspects of operating systems, including problem-solving. 

Let's begin by understanding what an operating system actually is, its functions, and what we can learn from it. 

## What is an Operating System?

An **operating system (OS)** is a program that manages computer hardware. It provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between computer users and the hardware. Here are some examples of widely used operating systems:

- Windows: Used in desktops and laptops.
- Linux and Ubuntu: Open-source operating systems used in various devices.
- Mac OS: Operating system used in Apple laptops (MacBooks).
- iOS: Operating system for iPhones.
- Android: Operating system for mobile devices.

To grasp the concept, let's take a look at the basic structure of a computer system through a diagram. The computer hardware includes resources such as the CPU, memory, and input/output (I/O) devices. Memory consists of primary memory (RAM) and secondary memory (ROM). Input devices include keyboards, mice, and microphones, while output devices include monitors and speakers. The operating system sits on top of the hardware.

## Role of the Operating System

Suppose we temporarily remove the operating system from the diagram. Without an operating system, every task would require explicit instructions to the computer hardware using code. Even simple tasks would become tedious and complex, dissuading users from using computer systems.

To overcome this problem, we have the operating system acting as an intermediary between users and the hardware. For example, when a user wants to type a document in Microsoft Word and save it, the operating system simplifies the process. The user can double-click on Microsoft Word, and the operating system takes care of opening the application, preparing the screen for typing, displaying the typed content, and saving the file to the hard disk. The operating system handles all the underlying tasks, making computer usage seamless and easy for users.

## Functions of an Operating System

The main functions of an operating system are as follows:

1. **Interface**: The operating system acts as an interface between the user and the hardware, simplifying communication and interaction.
2. **Resource Allocation**: It manages resource allocation, ensuring efficient distribution of resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices) among different users or processes.
3. **Memory Management**: The operating system manages memory, including loading programs into main memory and saving data to secondary memory.
4. **Security**: It ensures the security of the system, safeguarding against unauthorized access and protecting user data.

## Goals of an Operating System

The goals of an operating system are:

1. **Convenience**: The operating system provides convenience to users by simplifying complex tasks and enabling easy interaction with the hardware.
2. **Efficiency**: It ensures efficient utilization of system resources, allocating them effectively and optimizing system performance.

Operating systems are generally designed to achieve both convenience and efficiency, making computer usage more accessible and productive for users.
